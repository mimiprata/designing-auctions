export const ENGLISH_DESCRIPTION ="An English auction is a process in which an asset is sold through a suggested opening bid reserve or a starting price that is set by the seller. Increasingly higher bids are accepted from the gamut of buyers. Ultimately, the price is adjusted in a direction that's unfavorable to the bidders.\n"


export const SEALED_BID_DESCRIPTION = "A sealed-bid auction is a type of auction process in which all bidders simultaneously submit sealed bids to the auctioneer so that no bidder knows how much the other auction participants have bid.
