# An Ethereum-based implementation of English, Dutch and First-price sealed-bid auctions

The proposed blockchain solution offers a more secure alternative to a traditional online auction system, by providing a stand-alone platform that does not require contracting other modules to achieve a fair payment. This project addresses the problem of the traditional online auctions by proposing an Ethereum based implementation for three of the most popular auctions: English, Dutch, First-price sealed-bid (FPSB). Furthermore, smart contracts are defined for expressing the auctions based on strict rules regarding the role of the participants and stage delimitation.  While English and Dutch auction have a public character, the sealed bids from a FPSB can be questioned. The proposed solution incorporates the Merkle proof algorithm for honest verification of these offers. The experimental results show that a Dutch auction is more suitable for sellers, while an English auction for bidders in terms of transaction fees. Based on the behavior of each type of auction, the solution is exemplified by an English auction in the real-estate field, including a protocol for storing data off-chain - InterplanetaryFileSystem (IPFS).
